When I think about what’s going on in Washington right now	 it makes me sick. We live in the richest country in the world	 but families like mine struggle every day just to get by. And what are our so-called “representatives” doing about it?

Wouldn’t it be nice if finally – just for once – there were somebody in the Senate actually fighting for us	 instead of just yet another corporate Democrat or spineless Republican? In Joni Ernst’s last election	 she barely won with less than 52% of the vote. Now	 I’m the Democrat running against her in 2026 – and with your donation today	 we are going to turn Iowa blue and take back the Senate for Democrats. We can flip this Senate seat blue	 but we’ve set a goal to raise another $20	000 before midnight tonight to fight back against the billionaires and their Super PACs – and right now	 we’re still extremely short with time running out.

Life should not be this hard in the richest country in the world. Together	 we can take on greedy corporations – and the politicians they own – and we can win. Thank you	 Nathan Sage"""

April 15	 2025 at 5:00 pm EDT (Political Wire) “President Donald Trump says he wants to reduce our trade deficit.  Yet he’s destroying one of our winningest exports: higher education.” “Colleges and universities are among America’s most competitive international exporters.  In dollar terms	 last year	 the United States sold more educational services to the rest of the world than it sold in natural gas and coal combined.” Apparently unaware of this tremendous export advantage	 Trump is freezing funds to colleges and universities (so-called """"saving money"""") and eliminating grants to students from other countries.
