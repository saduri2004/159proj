167	Exaggerated Claims	"Tariffs, Trade Deals & the Government's Magic Trick  Ah yes, tariffs — the favorite political party trick. First, a big show about negotiating ""the greatest deals ever made"" with Canada and Mexico. Fast forward a few years, and suddenly those deals are “bad for America” and we need new tariffs to fix the economy again. We get it — bringing manufacturing back sounds patriotic. But here's the problem: businesses aren’t rushing home. Why would they? Moving operations costs more than just raising prices. So, like always, the American consumer gets stuck with the bill. Meanwhile, politicians get their talking points, and corporations stay exactly where they are. Here at DIA, we aren’t jacking up the prices. We’re handing you a $5 “Tariff Rebate” just for sticking with us. It’s automatically applied at checkout. Because if the government’s going to keep playing shell games with your wallet, someone’s got to have your back.
